# hello-world

This is my first post as recommended by the guide. But who reads the instruction manual anyway??

The core interests that have driven me to open an account include Bayesian neural network modelling, and the automation of financial market models that use non-traditional techniques to price assets in general. My specializations are toward derivatives markets, with current focus on currency markets in particular. I believe that the markets price inefficiently as a result of a number of failings of core asset pricing theory, and that it is possible to exploit these mispricings with trading strategies. Open to all discussions in this context, and I plan to show evidence of the emergent theories here. In addition, I intend to outline the use of derivatives prices to determine order flow.
